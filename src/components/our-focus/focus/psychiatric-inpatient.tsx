          While there are a multitude of adult psychiatric services and
          facilities nationwide, these often mix patients of varying ages and
          diagnoses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three Rivers Behavioral Health Inpatient Treatment program stands out
          as one of the very few hospitals that exclusively admit and treat
          older adults with primary psychiatric diagnoses in the inpatient
          setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to addressing primary psychiatric conditions, our
          exceptional clinical team provides care for those with medical and
          other secondary diagnoses, considering the unique medical, physical,
          emotional, and cognitive challenges of each patient.
