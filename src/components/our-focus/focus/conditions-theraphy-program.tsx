          Plan of Care Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
          At Three Rivers Behavioral Health, our focus is to ensure our patients
          return home swiftly, safely, and equipped to independently manage the
          challenges they had prior to our care.
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical stay at our hospital is approximately 10–14 days, during
          which a dedicated team works collaboratively to enhance the quality of
          life for both our patients and their families.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our comprehensive approach features activities including personalized
          therapy programs (a combination of individual, family, recreation,
          group, and adjunctive therapies depending on the patient) and daily
          living skills groups designed to improve memory, address mood
          regulation, and provide relaxation.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0097b2]">
          A Goal-Oriented Approach
        </h3>
        <p>
          Using various methods such as re-motivation, reminiscence and
          validation, our approach aims to inspire hope in the face of despair,
          facilitate progress amid past setbacks, and foster a revived sense of
          well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each morning, we conduct a brief goal-setting group where patients
          choose one or a few tasks to accomplish that day. Around breakfast
          time, patients will share their daily goals as they are able. Staff
          members provide support throughout the day to help patients accomplish
          these goals. During dinner, patients reflect on their progress and are
          asked to consider how well they met their daily goals. Goals can be
          simple, such as participating in a group activity or playing a game
          with another group member, and are guided by two key questions:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-6">
          <li>What am I doing today?</li>
          <li>What can I do to make it better?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0097b2]">
          Personalized Therapy Programs
        </h3>

        <p className="font-bold">Individual Therapy</p>
        <p>
          Tailored sessions where patients discuss their treatment plans,
          discharge preparations, and address any current issues with their
          therapist. The purpose of individual therapy is to keep patients
          involved, track goal progress, and improve the patient’s ability to
          problem-solve.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold">Family Therapy</p>
        <p>
          At Three Rivers Behavioral Health, we prioritize involving family
          members in patient care due to their invaluable knowledge of the
          patient’s family history and insights into the patient’s experiences.
          Family members often play a pivotal role in encouraging patients to
          seek psychiatric treatment. If patients or their legal guardians opt
          for family involvement during their treatment at Three Rivers
          Behavioral Health, our therapists facilitate family therapy sessions.
          These sessions assist the patient’s family in setting goals,
          evaluating progress, and strengthening family bonds.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold">Recreation Therapy</p>
        <p>
          Led by an Activity Therapist, these daily sessions focus on using free
          or leisure time to improve emotional well-being and the ability to
          express emotions. The Recreation Therapist uses various activities
          based on patients’ abilities to increase independence and improve
          physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning through
          participation. Contrasting traditional recreation programs, Three
          Rivers Behavioral Health’s activity therapy is goal and outcome
          oriented.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold">Group Therapy</p>
        <p>
          Group therapy plays a pivotal role in our treatment approach. Each
          day, patients are given the opportunity to interact with peers who may
          share similar symptoms, thus fostering empathy and mutual
          understanding of one another’s challenges and coping strategies. Our
          aim is to offer activities that enable patients to express themselves,
          acquire new problem-solving techniques, and enjoy meaningful social
          connections.
