        <p>
          While there are a multitude of adult psychiatric services and
          facilities nationwide, these often mix patients of varying ages and
          diagnoses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three Rivers Behavioral Health stands out as one of the very few
          hospitals that exclusively admit and treat older adults with primary
          psychiatric diagnoses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to addressing primary psychiatric conditions, our
          exceptional clinical team provides care for those with medical and
          other secondary diagnoses, considering the unique medical, physical,
          emotional, and cognitive challenges of each patient.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our Residential Program includes 24-hour supervision and intensive
          therapy that address mental health concerns, to include group therapy,
          and individual therapy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) is provided for adults, ages 18
          and older. The goal of our IOPs are stabilization, supportive
          increased therapy and the development of positive skills. Some of the
          signs and symptoms of mental health disorders we treat are:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6">
          <li>Depression</li>
          <li>Mood disorders</li>
          <li>Anxiety disorders</li>
          <li>Trauma history</li>
          <li>Suicidal ideation</li>
          <li>Self-harm behaviors</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The intensive outpatient program (IOP) can bridge the gap between
          acute care and individual therapy, can be an alternative for inpatient
          treatment or serve as a step-down from residential or acute mental
          health treatment.

          Comprehensive Approach to Treatment
        </h3>

        <p>
          Our team consists of psychiatrists, psychologists, internal
          medicine/physicians, nurse practitioners, social workers, and
          therapists (specializing in activity, occupational, physical, and
          speech therapy).
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, they work with the patients and one another to gain a
          thorough understanding of each patient’s specific symptoms and
          triggers, both psychiatric and medical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personalized strategies and plans of care are built to manage symptoms
          and enhance each patient’s ability to engage with others. Each day,
          patients participate in group activities that promote exercise,
          personal nutrition, socialization and stress management.
